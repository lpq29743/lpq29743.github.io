### About Me

My name is Peiqin Lin (林佩勤). Currently, I am a 2nd year M.Eng. student of School of Data and Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University and am expected to graduate in July 2020. I'm fortunate to specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Sentiment Analysis and Coreference Resolution, under the supervision of [Prof. Meng Yang](http://www.smartllv.com/members.html). **Note: I am seeking for Ph.D position now. If you have any interests, feel free to contact with me.**

### Research Interests

- Sentiment/Emotion Analysis
- Coreference Resolution
- Text Classification
- Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

### Education

- Sun Yat-sen University (2018 – 2020), M.Eng. in Software Engineering. Supervisor: [Prof. Meng Yang](http://www.smartllv.com/members.html)

- South China Normal University (2014 – 2018). B.Eng. in Software Engineering

### Publications

**Deep Mask Memory Networks with Semantic Dependency and Context Moment for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis.** First author, accepted by IJCAI 2019.

- Integrating semantic parsing information into deep memory network
- Modeling inter-aspect relation for utilizing the information of the nearby aspects
- Designing an auxiliary task to learn the sentiment distribution for the desired aspect

**Hierarchical Attention Network with Pairwise Loss for Chinese Zero Pronoun Resolution.** First author, accepted to AAAI 2020.

- Modeling zero pronouns and candidate antecedents interactively with Hierarchical Attention Mechanism
- Using pairwise loss instead of cross entropy loss used in previous methods
- Taking the constraint of correct-antecedent similarity into account for utilizing the chain information

**A Shared-Private Model with Joint Learning and Predict-then-Extend Extraction for Targeted Sentiment Analysis.** First author, submitted to ACL 2020.

- A shared-private network to exploit the relation between target extraction and target classification
- An heuristic predict-then-extend algorithm for target extraction

### Projects
