### About Me

My name is Peiqin Lin (林佩勤). Currently, I am a 2nd year M.Eng. student of School of Data and Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University and am expected to graduate in July 2020. I'm fortunate to specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Sentiment Analysis and Coreference Resolution, under the supervision of [Associate Prof. Meng Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2nw6DIAAAAJ&hl=en). **Note: I am seeking for Ph.D. position now. If you have any interests, feel free to contact me.**

### Research Interests

- Sentiment/Emotion Analysis
- Coreference Resolution
- Text Classification
- Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

### Education

- Sun Yat-sen University (2018 – 2020). M.Eng. in Software Engineering. Supervisor: [Associate Prof. Meng Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2nw6DIAAAAJ&hl=en).
- South China Normal University (2014 – 2018). B.Eng. in Software Engineering.
